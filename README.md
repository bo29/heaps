# heaps

This is a small project I did to demonstrate C#. I created the MinHeap object based on what was covered in my advanced data structures and algorithm design class. I also created a MaxHeap object for extra compatibility.

Both classes have their own implementation of HeapSort, which is well-known to be a reliable sorting algorithm but not always the fastest. MinHeap sorts the array in increasing order and MaxHeap sorts in decreasing order.
